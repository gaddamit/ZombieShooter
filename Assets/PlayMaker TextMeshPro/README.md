## Bugs & Updates

Currently no major bugs have been reported, however this is a work in progress. If you experience errors with this playmaker action set, please don't hesitate to contact me at tcmeric@gmail.com for further assistance.

Keep a special eye on the playmaker actions for shaders. This is a tricky area, especially for mobile shaders. Again, if any issues arise, please don't hesitate to report it so corrections can be made.
